## Kickstarter Analysis of Fundraising Campaign

### Background
Loiuse organised a fundraising campaign for her play "Fever" in June of 2016, the campaign ran for 1 month and ended in july of 2016. louise's campaign was categorised as "failed" because she was unable to meet the target.
PURPOSE:
Lousie requested an analysis of campaigns similar to hers so we can ascertain the relationship that exists between the campaign launch dates, its duration and the success of the campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In the analysis of the Campaign outcome based on the date of its launch, I focused on results such as the number of failed campaign, successful campaign and cancelled campaigns. I made use of a line chart to present the information, from the line chart we can see that the month of may had the highest number of campaigns, it also had the highest number of failed campaigns followed by the month of october. 

Challenge: A couple of factors can cause the number of campaigns and success rate of campaigns to change. We can assume that the month of May is in summer and more people will want to see plays at that period. I am unable to make an informed analysis just focusing on the time of month and the percentage of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Here, I separated the campaign goals into ranges and tried to determine the rate of success of fundraising based on the goal set. I made use of a line chart here as well. we can see from the information provided that campaign goals that were less than $1,000 had a higher percentage of meeting their goals, closed followed by campaigns whose goals were from $1,000 to $4999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I experienced challenges working with the "Countifs" function when i had to se the range of the goals. I eventually figured out that the "less down" function came before the "greater than" function and everything was easier. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The month of May is busy for fundraising and there is a higher chance of having a successful campaign.
2. May and June have the highest succes rate for theatre plays.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. the lesser the goal, the higher the chances of meeting said goal

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This date set covered period from 2009 to 2017 and covered plays from all categories. If the data was more focused on a span of 3 years i believe the results would have been more helpful to guide louise for her subsequent campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A line chart that used date with: the outcome, duration of campaign and the goal set would have given clearer results.
